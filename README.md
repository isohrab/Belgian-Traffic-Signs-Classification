## Belgian Traffic Signs Classification
#### A CNN with tensorflow
I used Belgian traffic signs images to classify with CNN in Tensorflow. You can download data set form [here](http://btsd.ethz.ch/shareddata/). There is a section with the title of __BelgiumTS for Classification (cropped images):__ .This dataset is very messy because the images have different sizes and the number of signs in each class is not equal. Also, there are a lot of low quality of images which makes predictions harder! and finally, There are 62 classes.
More information inside each notebook file.
